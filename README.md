# Little-Women-Social-Graph

This .ipynb file involves the social graph analysis (using networkx) of the novel "Little Women" by Louisa May Alcott, the plain text version of which has been downloaded from Project Gutenberg. Submitted this as my final assignment for my Graph Theory & its Applications course.
